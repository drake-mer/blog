I am David, I live currently in France, Paris.

My first field of study was physics and I finished a [PhD][phd-raman] 
in 2014 about greenhouse gases
and their spectral properties. 
You can find the [manuscript online][phd-publication].

I operated 3 years ago a shift in my professional activity, favoring the path of a 
software developer.

I am currrently working as a developer in the Paris area.
