I am David, I live in France, I currently work as a developer for a Cloud Provider
near the city of Paris.

The programming languages I use the most are Haskell and Python, currently I am digging
into Ruby and Scala. I love programming and this art never cease to amaze me.

My primary field of study is physics and I finished a [PhD][phd-raman] in 2014 about greenhouse gases
and spectral properties of such gases. The [manuscript][phd-publication] exists only in french, but you can
checkout the articles if needed.
