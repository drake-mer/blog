After going through the documentation to deploy a zinnia-django-blog
on a remote debian VPS, I preferred to go the easy way by deploying 
a static blog based on simple git-hooks for automatic publication.

This is going to be much more rewarding I believe, and the Jekyll
engine seems powerful enough to allow a lot of tweaking on the way.

I hope I will be able then to learn some ruby.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
