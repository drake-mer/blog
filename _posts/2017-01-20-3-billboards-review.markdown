# 3 billboards review

I don't know what kind of word to use for what I am going to write. Is this an essay ? A criticism ?
A short review ? An analysis ? Maybe a little bit of each. Anyway, I wanted to tell about my experience
in going to see _3 billboards_ at the cinema. I think it has all the features of a really exceptionnal
movie, alongside with a few minor disappointement I had. But as they say, art is difficult.

# Decorum, panorama and Missouri/Wyoming/Idaho etc.

I am not really a big USA fan. I don't know much of its culture, except for Mac Donalds
and Hollywood and all the mass consumption habits that come from the USA. NASA and space
exploration rings a bell too. I am a fan of Sci-Fi, and some of the greatest authors
outside are american natives (Silverberg, Frank Herbert, etc).

But there is a part of the USA culture that I find especially in 3 billboards. This is the
old perfume of the deprecated country-side fellows living far from the urban center and which
is more often forgotten in what people think about America.

3 billboard is both a satyre and a honourary statement about those people living in the
depth of the USA. Furthermore, all the story's environment is as beautiful as one would
wish, made of large hills covered with a luxuriant vegetation. The weather seems very
welcoming, wet still very likeable. The nature is really beautiful out there, and the
city seems like a lost heaven in the deep-country-side.

# Habitat and social habits

The beautiful nature, really omnipresent throughout the whole movie, is in a sharp contrast
with what is told from the people living here. The story's starting point is a sordid crime
having took place many monthes ago in which a young teenager has been raped and murdured.
The mother, which happens to be the main protagonist of the story, is absolutely overwhelmed
by a deep resentment (toward herself?) as well as a burning hatred for her daughter's killer.

She's a living picture of an aging, rural America, with a real will to fight for its 
disappeared child. From there, she decides to interpel the community by renting three
billboards (hence the name of the movie) which are a direct interpellation of the main 
police officer of the city.

Would I tell you more of the story, it would spoil you the discovery of the scenario, but
I can try to elaborate a little on the style of the movie and what is set up from this 
starting point.

Anyway, the action of Mildred are going to set up to flames (literally) the small 
town, by forcing the little society to look deep into its depravations and moral 
failures.

# A few words from an Ã¦sthetical point of view

The movie is really beautiful throughout. Its actors are, must I say, really all
outstanding. There is a special mention to give to the dumb cop (I forgot its name)
who is really a kind of red rope throughout all the movie. He is especially enticing
in the end while he might get you on your nerve at the beginning. The movie is
an assumed caricature of all of the deep south stereotype, with its mostly white
and racist middle class, and black people doing low-grad jobs, except in a few
peculiar cases whom the viewer will have all the details when viewing the whole story.

The sarcastic humor is really omnipresent and alterns regularly with more dramatic moment.
Although the story by itself is really a depressing one, the whole film never sinks into
the real darkness it could be if it had take itself too seriously.

As such, 3 billboards is really a dramatic comedy in the litteral sense. What I could only
regret about this movie is the mise en scene. While there is nothing too specific to claim
about the quality, it seems overall a little bit conventional, like a superposition of 
plans without too much linking and thinking into it. That's not what is catching the attention
in this movie, but instead let us glorify the magnific actor games.
